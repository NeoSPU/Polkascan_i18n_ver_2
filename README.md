# i18n for Polkascan
Polkascan PRE Explorer GUI Angular Application

## Description
I18n of Polkascan PRE Explorer GUI
The Polkascan PR Explorer GUI (https://github.com/polkascan/polkascan-pre-explorer-gui) is an Angular application. This feature is extending the Angular application with an internationalization and localization architecture. This, in turn, will make Polkascan PRE available and user-friendly to a worldwide audience in multiple languages and with multiple localization settings. WEB3SCAN (the organization behind Polkascan) will use this work to extend polkascan.io with internationalization and localization features.

## Usage

### How to translate Polkascan application

#### The JSON translation file
Each language is stored in a separate .json file. For example, the JSON file for the English translation: assets/i18n/en.json.

There`s can read 2 JSON formats:
```json
{
"demo.title": "Translation demo",
"demo.text": "This is a simple demonstration app for ngx-translate"
}
```

or

```json
{
"demo": {
"title": "Translation demo",
"text": "This is a simple demonstration app for ngx-translate"
}
}
```
This is just a matter of personal taste. The second one (so called namespaced-json format) is more structured and gives a better overview over the translations.


#### Using translations
`title` and `text` are identifiers ngx-translate uses to find the translation strings. 

You have two choices when it comes to adding translations:

- translation pipe — `{{'id' | translate}}`
- translation directive — `<element [translate]="'id'"></element>`

Both options lead to the same result — it's just a matter of personal tast which one you want to use.

```html
<div>
<!-- translation: translation pipe -->
<h1>{{ 'demo.title' | translate }}</h1>

<!-- translation: directive (key as attribute)-->
<p [translate]="'demo.text'"></p>

<!-- translation: directive (key as content of element) -->
<p translate>demo.text</p>
</div>
```

#### Translations with parameters

The i18n feature also supports parameters in translations. They are passed as an object, the keys can be used in the translation strings.

```html
<!-- translation: translation pipe -->
<p>{{ 'demo.greeting' | translate:{'name':'Andreas'} }}</p>

<!-- translation: directive (key as attribute) -->
<p [translate]="'demo.greeting'" [translateParams]="{name: 'Andreas'}"></p>

<!-- translation: directive (key as content of element)-->
<p translate [translateParams]="{name: 'Andreas'}">demo.greeting</p>
```

And the extended translations file:

```json
{
"demo": {
…
"greeting": "Hello {{name}}!"
}
}
```

### Update JSON files with ngx-translate-extract
Keeping the JSON files and our Polkascan in sync: there's a tool called `extract-translations` script. It scans our Angular app for the use of translations and adds new translations to your JSON files. 

A simple command now updates your JSON files:

```ts
npm run extract-translations
```

### Using translatable strings in your TypeScript files

Sometimes you have to add translatable strings to your TypeScript code. ngx-translate-extract needs a way to distinguish between these strings and all the other strings in your application.

This is where the marker function comes into play. The function itself does nothing — it only passes the string as a result.

```ts
import {_} from '@biesbjerg/ngx-translate-extract/dist/utils/utils';

{
…
var messageBoxContent = _('messagebox.warning.text');
…
}
```

### How to work with pluralization in Angular 7 and ngx-translate

Sometimes it's not enough to simply add a value to your translations. There are cases where parts or event the whole sentence has to change.

Think about the following situation: You want to display the number of images a user has uploaded.

- No image uploaded yet.
- One image uploaded.
- 123 images uploaded.

Or you want to display a dynamic value:

- My favorite color is green.
- My favorite color is red.
- My favorite color is blue.

The `translate-messageformat-compiler` is what you need now! It parses messages using the ICU syntax.

Update ***.component.html to render the new demo messages:

```html
<ul>
<li translate [translateParams]="{ count: 0 }">pluralization.things</li>
<li translate [translateParams]="{ count: 1 }">pluralization.things</li>
<li>{{'pluralization.things' | translate:"{ count: 2 }"}}</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li translate [translateParams]="{ gender: 'female', name: 'Sarah' }">pluralization.people</li>
<li translate [translateParams]="{ gender: 'male', name: 'Peter' }">pluralization.people</li>
<li>{{'pluralization.people' | translate:"{ name: 'Sarah + Peter' }"}}</li>
</ul>
```
Finally update the .json files with the new ICU syntax:

```json
{
"pluralization": {
"things": "There {count, plural, =0{is} one{is} other{are}} {count, plural, =0{} one{a} other{several}} {count, plural, =0{nothing} one{thing} other{things}}",
"people": "{gender, select, male{His name is} female{Her name is} other{Their names are }} {name}"
}
}
```
